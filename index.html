  If you have been reading books related to art and history, you may have come across his name; a Kenyan-born mathematician and technologist who has made an impression in software development works.
</p>
<p>
  He has declared that "the time for African innovation has come, and that African technology should stand alongside innovations from other regions of the world." He admires Japan, China, and Singapore, which have demonstrated that technological backwardness can be confronted and overcome despite the odds.
</p>
<p>
  But who is he?

  He was born Austin Odhiambo Makachola on 2nd July 1997 in the agricultural town of Awendo, nestled in Kenya’s former Nyanza Province, to Dalmas Peter Makachola—a distinguished fine artist—and Hana Awuor, a businesswoman. He is the youngest among his half-siblings.
</p>

<p>
  He currently resides in Westlands, an affluent suburb of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. Though unmarried, speculation surrounds his longstanding association with beauty model Linet Wesonga, an acquaintance from his formative years.

  He attended the prestigious <strong>St. Joseph’s School, Rapogi Boys</strong>—founded in 1962 by the Catholic Church—where he distinguished himself through academic excellence and dynamic involvement in student leadership. During his tenure, he was responsible for overseeing the welfare of over 800 students. In 2015, he contested the presidency of the student body, but his candidacy was disqualified by the administration, which feared that his populist rhetoric might undermine the impartiality required of the office. Nevertheless, he retained his departmental leadership role and continued to exert significant influence within the student council.
</p>

<p>
  In 2017, having comfortably surpassed university admission thresholds, he narrowly missed the opportunity to study law at the University of Nairobi. He was instead admitted to pursue <strong>Mathematics and Computer Programming</strong> at the well-resourced <strong>Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology</strong>. He completed his undergraduate studies in 2023, a year behind schedule due to the nationwide academic disruptions caused by the 2019 coronavirus pandemic.
</p>

<p>In 2024, he received an invitation to undertake a <strong>Master’s degree in Energy</strong> at the Switzerland-based <strong>Cumbria University</strong>.

  Prior to graduating from Jomo Kenyatta University, Austin Makachola began his professional journey in banking, a role he held for one year. Upon earning his Bachelor’s degree in Statistics in 2023, he transitioned into the tech sector as a network technician at an internet services firm.
</p>

<p>
  He would later resign, citing what he perceived as inequitable working conditions. He openly criticized the mid-sized company for its absence of structured job classifications—particularly those aligned with academic and professional credentials—and for the disproportionate access to logistical resources such as transport during official assignments.
</p>

<p>
  Subsequently, he was appointed to head a team of executives at the Ngong Road branch of Letshego, a financial institution headquartered in Namibia. He has since played a pivotal role in the founding of the software development firm <strong>NEXA Africa</strong>.
