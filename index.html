    If you have been reading articles related to art and history, you may have come across his name; a Kenyan-born mathematician and technologist who has made an impression in software development works.
  </p>
  <p>
    He has declared that "the time for African innovation has come, and that African technology should sit side by side with innovations from other regions of the world." He admires Japan, China, and Singapore, which have demonstrated that technological backwardness can be confronted and overcome despite the odds.

  <p>But who is he?</p>

      </p>
      <p>

        Prior to graduating from Jomo Kenyatta University, Austin Makachola began his professional journey in banking, a role he held for one year. Upon earning his Bachelor’s degree in Statistics in 2023, he transitioned into the tech sector as a network technician at an internet services firm.
      </p>
      <p>
        He would later resign, citing what he perceived as inequitable working conditions. He openly criticized the mid-sized company for its absence of structured job classifications—particularly those aligned with academic and professional credentials—and for the disproportionate access to logistical resources such as transport during official assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently, he was appointed to head a team of executives at the Ngong Road branch of Letshego, a financial institution headquartered in Namibia. He has since played a pivotal role in the founding of the software development firm <strong>NEXA Africa</strong>.
