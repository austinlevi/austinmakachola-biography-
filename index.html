<p>If you have been reading books related to art and history, you have come across the name "Austin Makachola"; a Kenyan-born mathematician and technologist currently making waves, particularly in software and AI development. <br><br>He has declared that the time for African innovation has come, and that African technology should stand alongside innovations from other regions of the world. He admires Japan, China, and Singapore which have demonstrated that technological backwardness can be confronted and overcome despite the odds. But who is he?</p>️

<div id="early-life" style="display: none;">HHe was born Austin Odhiambo Makachola on 2nd July 1997 in Kenya, in the small sugarcane-growing town of Awendo, Migori County, to Mr. Dalmas Peter Makachola (a fine arts lecturer) and Hana Awuor (a businesswoman). He is the last born among all his half-siblings.<br><br>

He now lives in Westlands, in Kenya's capital, Nairobi. He is unmarried, although rumors suggest he is dating beauty model Linet Wesonga, an acquaintance from his early years.</div>

<button onclick="toggleSection('education', this)">Education <span class="chevron">▶</span></button>
<div id="education" style="display: none;"> He attended an elite high school; St. Joseph’s School, Rapogi Boys (established in 1962 by the Catholic Church). There, he was active in both academics and student politics. Throughout his stay, he oversaw no fewer than 300 students. In 2015, he vied for the school presidency but was prevented from appearing on the ballot because the school administration felt his populist ideologies would compromise his duties as president. He retained his department chairmanship and remained highly influential in the council that was formed.<br><br>

In 2017, having easily attained university entry points, he missed a chance to study law at the University of Nairobi but was instead offered admission to study Mathematics and Computer Programming at the well-endowed Jomo Kenyatta University.<br><br>

He would graduate in 2023 (with a variance of one year, as universities closed nationwide in 2019 due to the coronavirus pandemic).<br><br>

A year later, he received an invitation to pursue a Master’s degree in Energy at the Switzerland-based Cumbria University.

<div id="career" style="display: none;">Prior to graduating from Jomo Kenyatta University, Austin Makachola first worked as a banker, a position he held for one year. After receiving his Bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2023, he was employed as a network technician at an internet services company.<br><br>

However, he later resigned due to what he considered unfair working conditions. He criticized the medium-sized company for its lack of defined job groups—particularly those aligned with education levels—and for the unequal access to company resources such as vehicles.<br><br>

Following his departure, he was invited to lead a team of executives managing the Ngong Road branch of the Botswana-based institution, Letshego. He has also been instrumental in establishing the software development firm NEXA Africa.
