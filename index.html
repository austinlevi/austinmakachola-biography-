  If you have been reading books related to art and history, you may have come across the name "Austin Makachola"—a Kenyan-born mathematician and technologist currently making waves, particularly in software and AI development.
</p>
<p>
  He has declared that "the time for African innovation has come, and that African technology should stand alongside innovations from other regions of the world." He admires Japan, China, and Singapore, which have demonstrated that technological backwardness can be confronted and overcome despite the odds.
</p>
<p>
  But who is he?
</p>

  He was born Austin Odhiambo Makachola on 2nd July 1997 in Kenya, in the agricultural town of Awendo, Migori County, to Dalmas Peter Makachola (a fine artist) and Hana Awuor (a businesswoman). He is the last born among all his half-siblings.
</p>

<p>
  He now resides in Westlands, in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. He is unmarried, although rumors suggest he is dating beauty model Linet Wesonga—an acquaintance from his early years.

<div id="education" style="display: none;"> <p>
  He attended an elite high school—St. Joseph’s School, Rapogi Boys (established in 1962 by the Catholic Church). There, he was active in both academics and student politics. Throughout his stay, he oversaw no fewer than 800 students. In 2015, he vied for the school presidency but was barred from appearing on the ballot, as the administration believed his populist ideals could compromise his role. Nonetheless, he retained his department chairmanship and remained a key influence in the student council.
</p>

<p>
  In 2017, having easily met university entry qualifications, he missed the opportunity to study law at the University of Nairobi but was instead admitted to study Mathematics and Computer Programming at the well-endowed Jomo Kenyatta University.
</p>

<p>
  He graduated in 2023, a year later than expected, due to the nationwide university closures in 2019 caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
</p>

<p>
  In 2024, he received an invitation to pursue a Master’s degree in Energy at Switzerland-based Cumbria University.

<div id="career" style="display: none;"><p>
  Prior to graduating from Jomo Kenyatta University, Austin Makachola first worked as a banker—a position he held for one year. After receiving his Bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2023, he was employed as a network technician at an internet services company.
</p>

<p>
  He later resigned from the role, citing what he considered unfair working conditions. He criticized the medium-sized company for its lack of defined job groups—particularly those based on professional and academic qualifications—and for the unequal access to transportation for official duties.
</p>

<p>
  Following his departure, he was invited to lead a team of executives managing the Ngong Road branch of the Namibian-based institution, Letshego. He has also been instrumental in establishing the software development firm, NEXA Africa.
